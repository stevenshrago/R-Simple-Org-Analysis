x axis missing - added x axis to low spans; in small multiple graphs x-axis is onlt at the bottom
benchmark misspelling - fixed
using OrgVue for whole org mgr percent and ave span = ok

Jiamei for member engagement - manual edit to underlying data
Missing commpression because there was no compression in those snapshots
grade development - added formatting
% exec roles - coloring is dependent on being within the grey/benchmark range, not dependent on lululemon average (see mnager percentages)
